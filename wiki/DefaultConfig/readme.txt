PLEASE READ BEFORE INSTALL!

To use Workouteditor for GoldenCheetah the first time:

1. Install it to a Folder of your choice (I recommend not to use C:\Program Files due to UAC)

2. Choose what files you want to install. Package come with (It is recommended at first install)
	- Default Config
	- Examples (Year Plan, Week Plan, Standard Workouts)

3. Put in your User Data	
	Athlete Insert your Name. This entry represent the Athlete Folder of you in GC
	Example: Andreas
	
	Athlete Year of Birth: Insert your Year of Birth. It is necessary to calculate Run and Swim total work / KCalories
	
    Path Schedule Files: Insert where the Schedule files should be stored. (Use Browse button)
    Example: C:\Dropbox\WorkoutEditor
	
    Path Standard Workouts Files: Insert where the Standard Workout files should be stored. (Use Browse button)
    Example: C:\Dropbox\WorkoutEditor

	Note: You can use the installation folder but if you use a cloud folder you can access the files from different PCs	

4. Dependig on the files selection you can select if these files should be used. Select them in "WorkoutEditor Examples" page.
	WARNING: if you select these files all files in Path Schedule Files and Path Standard Workouts Files are getting overwritten!
	
5. WorkoutEditor use some information out of user defined fields from GC. I used e.g Workout Code (Short Text) and Workout Content (Text) to store WorkoutCode and 
   the average of Intervall / common workout information to GC. You have to define user fields in GC(if not already done) and add these fields in Preferences. 
   Go to Selections Tab, select JsonFile and add the Name of the fields.	
   
6. You can use the predefined values in Selections for Sport, Level, Phase, Cycle, WorkoutCode and IntEdtior but of course you can delete them and create your own 
   but don´t delete entries Athlete,Device and Sport in JsonFile!
